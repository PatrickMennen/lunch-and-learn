# Lunch and Learn

This is the front- and backend presented at the Lunch & Learn on the 16th of November 2021.

## Installation
Install the modules either using `yarn` or `npm`.

## Usage

Start the backend from packages/backend using `yarn start` or `npm run start`
Start the frontend from packages/frontend using `yarn start` or `npm run start`

Note: The order is important, the frontend queries the backend for its schema

## Things worth trying to implement
- Add a subscription that updates the count for a team when a task is modified
- Subscribe to newly generated task lists and tasks
